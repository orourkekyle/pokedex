# POKÉDEX SEARCH:

## Welcome to the Pokédex Search app.
In this app, the user will type in a pokémon and once they click the pokeball, the page will display their card (pulling stats from PokeAPI) and will also display the most relevant video from YouTube pertaining to the pokemon that was searched. 

For styling, we used Foundation (Zurb) as well as Bootstrap. We also wanted to style it with the pixeled/90's look to bring back some nostalgia. We also created a gradient yellow effect on the cards to remind users of the cards that came out in the late 90s.
